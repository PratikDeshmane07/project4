# Heart Disease Prediction App Project

## Overview
In this project, we focused on leveraging machine learning to predict heart disease, transforming raw data into actionable insights and a practical application. Our journey from data processing to model deployment showcases the blend of analytical rigor and technical proficiency.

## Repository Structure
- `App Development`: 
  - Contains the Streamlit-based application, utilizing `joblib` for model deployment.
- `Model Optimization`: 
  - Features `scikit-learn` for model tuning, with a focus on `GridSearchCV` for parameter optimization.
  - Final model performance metrics:
    - Accuracy: 0.8804
    - Precision: 0.8972
    - Recall: 0.8972
    - F1 Score: 0.8972
    - AUC-ROC: 0.8772
    - R2 Score: 0.5837
- `Model Testing`: 
  - Evaluates a range of models to determine the most effective:
    - Decision Trees
    - Logistic Regression
    - RandomForest Classifier
    - Support Vector Machines
    - XGBoost
- `Neural Network Models`: 
  - Contains neural network models designed for pattern recognition and predictions.
- `Visualizations`: 
  - Houses visual outputs from `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data representation.
- `archive`: 
  - A collection of supplementary and exploratory files.
- `data`: 
  - Managed with `pandas`, includes both raw and processed datasets, demonstrating extensive data processing.
