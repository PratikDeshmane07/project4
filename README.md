# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Our goal is to aid in the early detection and management of heart conditions, leveraging a dataset that combines multiple studies on heart disease.

## Context
Cardiovascular diseases are the foremost cause of death globally, necessitating early detection methods. By applying machine learning, we strive to provide a tool that can predict heart disease occurrence with significant accuracy.

## Dataset Attributes
The dataset encompasses several features such as age, sex, type of chest pain, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. These attributes are integral to our predictive model's accuracy.

## Goals and Requirements
- **Data Model Implementation**: Develop, train, and evaluate a Python-based model.
- **Data Model Optimization**: Optimize the model to achieve a minimum of 75% accuracy or an R-squared value of 0.80.
- **GitHub Documentation**: Maintain a well-documented GitHub repository with all project materials.
- **Group Presentation**: Deliver a collective presentation detailing our findings and the model's utility.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For creating the predictive model and preprocessing data.
- **SQL/Apache Spark**: To retrieve data for model training.
- **GitHub**: For documentation and version control.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For iterative development and visualizations.

## Data Source
We will be using a detailed dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which amalgamates data from various heart disease studies into one comprehensive set.

- **Dataset**: [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)
