# Heart Disease Prediction App Project

## Overview
This machine learning project is dedicated to predicting heart disease. The project's structure guides users from raw data exploration to a sophisticated machine learning model, culminating in a user-friendly predictive application.

## Repository Structure
- `App Development`: Contains the application codebase, showcasing the final, user-interactive product of our project.
- `Model Optimization`: Features scripts and notebooks detailing the process of hyperparameter tuning and model refinement.
- `Model Testing`: Holds the validation and testing files that assess the performance and reliability of our models.
- `Neural Network Models`: Contains the neural network models that are the cornerstone of the application's predictive capabilities.
- `Visualizations`: Provides graphical representations and insights derived from the data and model outcomes.
- `archive`: Houses supplementary or historical data and files that supported the project's development.
- `data`: Includes both the raw and processed datasets used in the project, reflecting the entire data processing journey.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the support and guidance provided by [UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics Boot Camp](https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/data/), which has been invaluable throughout this project.

Additionally, we extend our heartfelt gratitude to the broader machine learning community and acknowledge the following contributions that have been fundamental to our project:
- The Kaggle project "Heart Failure Prediction" by fedesoriano, which served as an inspiration for our work. The project can be found at [Heart Failure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).
- The original heart disease dataset creators, whose work has been foundational in our analyses:
  - Janosi, Andras
  - Steinbrunn, William
  - Pfisterer, Matthias
  - Detrano, Robert

The dataset, dating back to June 30, 1988, was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and has been instrumental in our project's development. For further details on the dataset, please refer to the citation below:
